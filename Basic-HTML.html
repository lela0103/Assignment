            <p>The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960, that comprised</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon" target="_blank">John Lennon</a>, </li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney" target="_blank">Paul McCartney</a>,</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison" target="_blank">George Harrison</a>,</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringo_Starr" target="_blank">Ringgo Starr</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They are regarded as <strong>the most influential band of all time</strong> and were integral to the 
                development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form.
                Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of 
                classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music 
                styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers 
                in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many 
                aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth 
                and sociocultural movements.
