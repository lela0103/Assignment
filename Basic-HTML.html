        <p>The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960, that comprised</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon">John Lennon</a>, </li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>,</li>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringo_Starr">Ringgo Starr</a>.</li>
        </ul>
         <p>They are regarded as <strong>the most influential band of all time</strong> and were integral to the 
             development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form.
             Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of 
             classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music 
             styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers 
             in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many 
             aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth 
             and sociocultural movements.</p>
